If you are interested in becoming a member of the Inclusivity Working Group, please [submit your application here](https://nebrius.typeform.com/to/dsvEs5). If you would like to learn more about member responsibilities, please [check out our Roles and Responsibilities guide](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/docs/roles-responsibilities.md).

# Process Notes

- Submissions are anonymous, only members of the inclusivity WG can see the responses.
- Submissions are discussed privately by current members of the Inclusivity WG.
- Applicants will receive either an acceptance or rejection message via their supplied email.
    - The results are not made public by the WG.
    - Applicants are free to make the response public, if so desired.
- Once accepted, new members will be:
    - Publicly listed on GitHub, and have voting rights in all Working Group matters.
    - Added as a collaborator to the repository.
    - Invited to the Slack channel*.

* Although Slack is a private communication system, the Inclusivity Working Group makes the contents of the Slack team public after a period of time. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

# Voting criteria

Applications will be considered using the following criteria:

- Does the applicant have a reasonable understanding of inclusivity and diversity?
- Does the applicant seem sincere in their application, i.e. not a troll?
- Does the applicant bring a new perspective to the Inclusivity Working Group?

# Response steps:

- The application is discussed as a group on Slack to try and arrive at a consensus. It is not a blind vote without discussion first.
- Once a decision is ready to be made, a vote is taken by the WG members. This is the official selection process, with the vote result being binding.
    - Applicants are approved by unanimous vote only.
- If accepted, an invitation to the Slack is sent, the applicant is added as a collaborator to the GitHub repository, and their name is added to the official list of members.
- If the candidate is rejected, a document is drafted summarising the reasons for rejection. This should relate clearly back to the voting criteria above. This document is sent to the email they supplied in the Typeform.
