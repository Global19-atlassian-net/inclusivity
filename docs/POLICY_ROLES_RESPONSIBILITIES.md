# Roles and Responsibilities
This document outlines the major roles and responsibilities associated with the inclusivity working group.

## Roles
The inclusivity working group has two main roles for participants.

### Member
Members are the core group of people responsible for the inclusivity working group. Members make a regular commitment to participating in the working group and contributing to deliverables. The target size for membership is 6-12 people.

The current list of members can be found [here](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity#initial-membership).

#### Becoming a member
See the [admissions policy](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/blob/master/docs/POLICY_ADMISSIONS.md) for details about the process for becoming a member.

#### Responsibilities
Members are expected to commit at least 10 hours a month (**Question for PR: is this time commitment too much/little?**) towards the working group's responsibilities. Members are expected to contribute in some way every two weeks because the group delivers on a biweekly basis.

A member's time commitment can be spent on a variety of contributions including, but not limited to: 

- Preparing and participating in working group meetings. See [issue #64](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/issues/64) for discussion around the roles and responsibilities for meetings.
- Developing new policies, documentation, etc. for the group (e.g. [add CONTRIBUTING.md content](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/pull/88)).
- Developing resources for the wider node community (e.g. [Getting Started in Node.js Program](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/issues/96)).
- Reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/pulls) on the inclusivity repository.
- Moderating [issues](https://github.com/nodejs/inclusivity/issues) on the inclusivity repository.
- Assisting with moderation outside the inclusivity repository, when the group is asked for help.
- Responding to emails and other outside requests sent to the inclusivity working group.
- Participating in discussions on the private and/or public working group slack channels.
- Outreach with other communities.
- Operations (e.g. managing membership for slack, github).
- Reviewing, voting on, and responding to membership requests.

**Question for PR: Do we want to have requirements around attending meetings? If so, I'd like them to be a little loose to account for difficulties with time zones and accessibility, so we aren't losing diversity in our membership.**

**Question for PR: Do we want to have anything about the member-only slack channel here, since we sometimes use it for discussions?**

**Question for PR: Do we want to add something here about responsibilities around the code of conduct? I feel like members may be held to a higher standard.**

If a member will be unavailable to meet these responsibilities, they are expected to notify the group in a timely manner, so resources can be planned accordingly. A member who cannot maintain these responsibilities for a significant amount of time will be asked to transition to a collaborator role.

#### Permissions

Members have the following level of access and permissions for the working group.

- Are allowed to speak on behalf of the group in outreach, emails, etc.
- Have access to member-only, private slack channel.
- Receive emails sent to the working group's email ([inclusivity@nodejs.org](mailto:inclusivity@nodejs.org)).
- Have **INSERT PERMISSION/ORG LEVEL INFORMATION HERE** access on github.
- Has priority for participation in working group meetings (because there are limited slots available in google hangouts).

### Collaborator
Collaborators are people who contribute to the inclusivity working group, but do not have specific responsibilities and commitments.

#### Becoming a collaborator
**QUESTION FOR PR: Do we have a policy for becoming a collaborator? Should we? How does this work?**

### Responsibilities

Collaborators do not have any specific time or deliverable commitments. They may contribute to the working group as much or as little as they like.

Collaborator contributions may include, but are not limited to:

- Making pull requests on the inclusivity repository.
- Contribution to discussions on issues and pull requests in the inclusivity repository.
- Participating in discussions on the public working group slack channel (to be created in the near future).

#### Permissions

Collaborators have the following level of access and permissions for the working group.

- Have access to public slack channel. This does not currently exist, but will be created some time in the near future.
- Have **INSERT PERMISSION/ORG LEVEL INFORMATION HERE** access on github.
- May participate in working group meetings when space allows.

Collaborators **DO NOT** have permission to do the following.

- Collaborators can not speak for the working group in outreach, emails, etc. unless explicitly given permission by members.
- Collaborators do not have access to private working group communications (e.g. private slack channel, emails sent to the working group email address).
